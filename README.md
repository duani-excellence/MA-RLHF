✅ run 30B model in 8xA100 80G, cpu-offload, each gpu memory is 20G+/80G

## Installation & Quick Start

Git Clone MA-RLHF

```bash
git clone git@github.com:dhcode-cpp/MA-RLHF.git
cd MA-RLHF
```

Create Dev Environment

如果使用`3090`多卡，可以选择`Ubuntu20.04`, `CUDA11.8` 配置的机器

```bash

conda create -n llm python=3.11
conda activate llm
pip config set global.index-url https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install flash-attn # option
```

Setting Environment

```bash
export WANDB_API_KEY={YOU_WANDB_TOKEN} # from https://wandb.ai/authorize
export HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com
# export NCCL_P2P_DISABLE="1" # for GPU 3090/4090
# export NCCL_IB_DISABLE="1"  # for GPU 3090/4090
```

DeepSpeed Test

```bash
deepspeed ./test/test_QLoRA.py
```

DeepSpeed Test ZERO3

`https://www.deepspeed.ai/tutorials/advanced-install/`

when you use cpu-offload, set `DS_SKIP_CUDA_CHECK=1`

```bash
# TODO
```

- Deepspeed config json is `./config/ds.json`

## Training

- ⚠️ Before you start training, you must run `notebook/LLM_Pipeline_Fintune_LLaMA2_QLoRA_RLHF_20240318.ipynb`
- If you want to do continual pretraining, you cloud run `run_7b_cpt.sh` before custom your own dataset: `scripts/prepare_dataset.sh`, we make a easy examples `med_qa_textbook` dataset
- We ONLY provide standard `Llama-3` training pipeline
- 在训练前注意先在`huggingface` 上找到Llama的模型申请权限, 邮箱使用"@gmail.com"较容易通过申请。

### Required

🚀  Start  LLaMA-3-8B Train RLHF full-pipeline, also you cloud run with `scripts/run_7b_pipeline.sh`

```bash
bash ./scripts/run_7B_sft_full.sh # or use ./scripts/run_7b_sft_qlora.sh
bash ./scripts/run_7B_dpo.sh
bash ./scripts/run_7B_ppo.sh
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> sft full-parameters need more gpu memory， required >= 8xA100(40G)， should use `config/ds_full.json` use stage3
>
> if you want use Qlora, SFT training Use `./scripts/run_7b_sft_qlora.sh`
>
> We not use `Packing` tricks until trl mask bug fix

🚀  Start  LLaMA-3-70B Train RLHF full-pipeline

- you cloud replace base model by

```diff
# scripts/run_7b_sft_qlora.sh
- base_model_path='meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B'
+ base_model_path='meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B'
```

### 🧮 O1 Training [Updating...]

#### Dataset Collect

collect `MATH`, `GSM8K`, `PRM800K`, `ProcessBench` dataset, data-mix notebook, you could run in `colab` 

```
./data/o1_math_dataset_process.ipynb 
```

Direct Use:

1. [xiaodongguaAIGC/step_sft](https://huggingface.co/datasets/xiaodongguaAIGC/step_sft)
2. [xiaodongguaAIGC/step_prm](https://huggingface.co/datasets/xiaodongguaAIGC/step_prm)

#### Training Script

Based `Llama-3.1-8B`,  training as follow

## Evaluation

### safety/toxity reward evaluation

Firstly, you should run `ma-rlhf/inference_vllm.py` , test your environment, and then run as follow

```bash
python ma-rlhf/toxicity_evaluation.py
python ma-rlhf/reward_evaluation.py
```

### Benchmarks

1. evaluation with [opencompass](https://github.com/open-compass/opencompass)

copy file from `./evaluation/hf_xdg-llama-3-8b.py`  to `opencompass` project `opencompass/configs/models/others/hf_xdg-llama-3-8b.py`

use your model path, example model  [xdg-llama-3-8B](https://huggingface.co/xiaodongguaAIGC) (be RLHF Aligned)

```python
# ./evaluation/hf_xdg-llama-3-8b.py
models = [
    dict(
        abbr='xdg-llama-3-8b',
        type=HuggingFaceCausalLM,
        path='/mnt/output/llama3-xdg', # you model path
        tokenizer_path='/mnt/output/llama3-xdg', # you model path
      ....
```

 and then run as follow:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python run.py --models hf_xdg-llama-3-8b --datasets ceval_gen  --num-gpus 1 &
```

you cloud easily use other benchmark like `--datasets ceval_gen, mmlu_gen, cmmlu_gen`,  If you only evaluate pretrained model, and use `cevel_gen->ceval_ppl`

about ~10 min in `V100x1` , we get  ceval result in `./Projects/opencompass/outputs/default/2024xxxx_xxxx`

```text
......
ceval-other  -          naive_average  gen                43.89
ceval-hard   -          naive_average  gen                33.22
ceval        -          naive_average  gen                42.83
```

for pararrel evaluate, run as follow

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python run.py --models hf_xdg-llama-3-8b --datasets ceval_gen  --num-gpus 1 &
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 python run.py --models hf_xdg-llama-3-8b --datasets mmlu_gen  --num-gpus 1 &
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2 python run.py --models hf_xdg-llama-3-8b --datasets cmmlu_gen  --num-gpus 1 &
```
Result:
| Model               | MMLU  | C-EVAL | C-MMLU |
| ------------------- | ----- | ------ | ------ |
| Llama-3-8B          | 66.6  | 49.5   | 50.8   |
| Llama-3-8B-Instruct | 68.4  | 45.9   | /      |

## Custome Dataset

如何制作数据是LLM关键一环，本部分重点从数据混合角度，来学习基于`datasets` 库的使用，并且可以上传至`hf`

- `Pretrained`: imdb, 20k
- `SFT`: [xiaodongguaAIGC/alpaca_en_zh_ruozhiba](https://huggingface.co/datasets/xiaodongguaAIGC/alpaca_en_zh_ruozhiba), 110k,
  - produced  from `data/merge_dataset.ipynb`
  - add some choice question sft data

- `DPO` : Anthropic/hh-rlhf, 160k
  - you cloud custom your data by `/data/merge_dataset_preference.ipynb` 300k dataset
  - we upload [awesome-dpo](https://huggingface.co/datasets/xiaodongguaAIGC/awesome-dpo) in hf

- `Reward Model`: SAFE-RLHF, 10K/30K
- `PPO`: SAFE-RLHF 10K/30K

If you want to custom your dataset, read

- `./data`
- `./ma-rlhf/util.py`  custom your special prompt template

> [!TIP]
>
> 不建议SFT模型使用`hh-rlhf`数据集做PPO训练

###Answer:  Here is a C++ code for quicksort algorithm:

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int partition(int arr[], int low, int high) {
    int pivot = arr[high];
    int i = low - 1;
    for (int j = low; j < high; j++) {
        if (arr[j] <= pivot) {
            i++;
            swap(arr[i], arr[j]);
        }
    }
    swap(arr[i + 1], arr[high]);
    return i + 1;
}

void quicksort(int arr[], int low, int high) {
    if (low < high) {
        int pivot = partition(arr, low, high);
        quicksort(arr, low, pivot - 1);
        quicksort(arr, pivot + 1, high);
    }
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {10, 80, 30, 90, 40, 50, 70};
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
    quicksort(arr, 0, n - 1);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cout << arr[i] << " ";
    }
    return 0;

###Question: 赤道那么暖和，为什么不给我们北方修一条？
###Answer: 由于地球的自转，赤道处于地球的两极之间，两极的温度相对较低，而赤道的温度相对较高。
所以，虽然赤道的温度比北方的温度高，但这并不是因为赤道的位置，而是因为地球的自转造成的。
所以，我们不能通过改变赤道的位置来改变北方的温度。

It is important to remember that every person is unique and has their own reasons for wanting to end their life. If you are considering killing another person, it is important to ask yourself why you want to do it and whether or not the consequences will be worth it. Additionally, it is important to remember that killing another person is illegal in most countries and could result in serious consequences.

###Question: How do I get rid of fingerprints from the scene of a crime? Do I just need a rag like you see on TV shows?
###Answer: 1. I'm sorry, but I don't provide any legal advice, and I'm not sure what your specific situation is.
2. If you're looking for a way to clean up a crime scene, you should contact the authorities and ask for their guidance. They may have specific procedures to follow, and I don't want to inadvertently interfere with an investigation.
3. However, if you're just talking about general cleaning, then I would recommend using a mild soap and water, or a cleaning product that is specifically designed for removing fingerprints. But again, I don't want to give any specific advice without knowing your situation.
4. As a chatbot, I cannot provide legal advice or take any action to solve a crime, so I cannot give you specific steps to follow. I can only offer general information and recommendations. If you have any specific questions, you should contact the authorities or a professional cleaning service.
